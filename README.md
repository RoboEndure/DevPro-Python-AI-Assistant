# SpeechRecognition-Assistant-Python

This Project is very famous for the beginner python programmer & every programmer. I thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant in python (Not Like Jarvis Shit! , Its just a speech recognition thing) Speech recognition can by donw using the Python SpeechRecognition modile. We make use of the Google Speech API because of its great quality.   Before we get to the nitty-gritty of doing speech recognition in Python, Let's 

How TTS Works - A computer system used to create artificial speech is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A TTS (Text-To-Speech) system converts normal language text into speech. How can we use speech synthesis in python.

GTTS - I found a script on Github that uses the Google speech engine. The script comes with many options and does not speak, instead it saves to an mp3. We added a command to play the mp3 automatically:

PYTTSX - 
Pyttsx is a cross-platform speech (Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux) library. You can set voice metadata such as age, gender, id, language and name. Thee speech engine comes with a large amount of voices.



for speech recognition, you need to use speechrecognition. This great resource offers t efreedom to use sphinx project to convert the audio input into a text. You can also use Google services and to do the same with the help of speech recognition.

Now that you’ve got everything you need, let’s take a look at Jarvis’s Brain which is basically the code written by Mr. Gulati. You can assemble the above-mentioned resources and libraries to create your own AI assistant.
The code shared below is pretty straightforward and you can get things done after few hours of work and research. Take a look:
